    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Butter Chicken</strong> is a <em>rich, creamy, and flavorful dish</em> that is a staple in Indian cuisine. 
        It features succulent pieces of chicken simmered in a <em>spiced tomato-based gravy</em> 
        that is thickened with yogurt and heavy cream, giving it a velvety texture. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Cashews</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, and spices (turmeric, garam masala, cumin, chili powder, ginger, garlic). Add the chicken pieces and mix well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp of ghee or oil in a large skillet or pan over high heat. Add the chicken pieces in batches (do not overcrowd the pan). Cook for about 3 minutes per side, or until the chicken is lightly charred and mostly cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Aromatics: In the same pan, melt the remaining butter or ghee over medium heat. Sauté finely chopped onions, ginger, and garlic until soft.
        Spices & Tomato: Add spices (cumin, garam masala, Kashmiri chili powder) and tomato passata (or crushed tomatoes). Cook for 5-7 minutes until the mixture thickens and the oil starts to separate.</li>
        <li><em>Optional - Smooth Sauce: For a restaurant-style silky sauce, blend this mixture in a blender until smooth.
        Simmer: Return the sauce to the pan, add the cream, sugar, and kasoori methi. Stir to combine.</em></li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken (and any resting juices) back into the sauce. Simmer on low heat for 5-10 minutes to allow the chicken to fully cook through and absorb the flavor.</li>
    </ol>
