            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Alfredo-based pasta is always a good idea, 
                but this pasta bake is one of our favorites. 
                In this recipe, shrimp is tossed in an easy 
                from-scratch Alfredo sauce and penne before being 
                topped with two (yes, two) types of cheese. It's baked until 
                you have a bubbling, cheesy dinner that is just as perfect on busy 
                weeknights as it is for fancy date nights. Pair with your favorite 
                side dishes for pasta, and you'll have a weeknight stunner 
                ready in less than 30 minutes that will make weeknights feel extra special.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange one rack in the top position and a second rack in the middle of the oven. Heat the oven to 375°F. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Add 1 pound dried spaghetti to the boiling water and cook according to package directions for 1 minute less than al dente. Meanwhile, make the sauce</li>
                <li>Melt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Whisk in 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour and cook until it is golden brown and smells toasted, about 2 minutes</li>
                <li>Slowly whisk in 3 cups whole milk and 1 cup heavy cream. Bring to a boil, whisking occasionally. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the sauce is slightly thickened, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk in 4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, 3 ounces of the finely grated Parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt until smooth.</li>
                <li>When the spaghetti is ready, drain. Add to the sauce and toss until combined. Taste and season with more kosher salt if needed. Transfer to an 8x8-, 9x9-, or 9x13-inch broiler-safe baking dish and arrange into an even layer. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 ounces shredded mozzarella and 1 ounce Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake on the middle rack until the edges are bubbling and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes. For additional browning, move the baking dish to the top rack. Turn the oven onto broil and broil until the cheese is browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Garnish with finely chopped fresh parsley leaves if using before cutting into pieces like a lasagna and serving.</li>
